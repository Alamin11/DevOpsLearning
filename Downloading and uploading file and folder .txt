Downloading and uploading file and folder to or from the server machine to client machine using SCP commands on ssh server 
Step1: We need the server machine’s IP address, to know -
#ip a
Collect or remember the IP address that comes after enet 
Now download a file from the remote server machine to the client machine 


Step2: From the client machine, we need to run a command like following format
$scp remoteUserName@ipOfRemoteServer:filePath clientLocation
In my case:- $scp root@192.168.0.106:/root/remoteFile.txt /home/al-amin/Dwonloads


Entering there need authentication confirmation, just type yes. Done, now we can check the downloads directory and see our downloaded remoteFile.txt using cd and ls commands.


Now upload a file from the client machine to the remote server machine 
Step3: Just same as we downloaded file, but this time we need to change a bit like client file path first and server location last -
$scp clientFilePath remoteUserName@ipOfRemoteServer:remoteFilePath
In my case, $scp /home/al-amin/clientFile.txt root@192.168.0.106:/root/Desktop


Now we don’t need to authenticate again, we just need to give the remote server password and done.
To check, now we need to go to the server machine and go to the Desktop directory. 


N.B: One thing to remember the file path /location here is absolute
