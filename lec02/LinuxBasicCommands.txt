#What is a shell ?
Shell is a program that takes commands from keyboard and 
passes it to operating system to carry out.

#What is terminal emulator ?
When we use graphical user interface(GUI) , we need another program to 
interact with the shell - is called terminal emulator which is simply called terminal.

#Lunching terminal emulator or terminal : 
Simply open up from show application on the lower left corner. 
short cut key -> ctrl+alt+t
It will open up with something that we call shell prompt like this ->me@linuxbox:~$
If the last character is a dollar(#)sign then it indicates a superuser or root or have the super user previlages. 

#Quick copy-and-paste technique in shell prompt :
Highlighting some text by holding down the left mouse button and dragging 
the mouse over it (or double-clicking a word), it is copied into a buffer maintained by X. Pressing the middle mouse button will cause the text to be pasted 
at the cursor location.

*********************Some simple commands*******************

$date -> this will represent the current date and time 
$cal -> This will display current month's calender
$df -> Will display the free amount of spaces of our disk drives.
$free -> display the amount of free space
$exit -> Ending a session of a terminal emulator window by closing the terminal.

********************Chapter2-File system in linux**************
#Linux have a single file system tree, regardless of how many drives 
or storage devices are attached to the computer.

$pwd -> display the current working directory 
$ls -> listing all the files and directories of current working directory.
	Actually we can use 'ls' command to listing the content of any directory .
$ls -1 ->display the listing in a columnar way
$ls -a ->Filenames that begin with a period character are hidden. This only means 
	that ls will not list them unless we say ls -a

#changing the working directory 
we can change the directory in two ways using absolute pathnames and 
relative path names

#Absolute path name : An absolute pathnamebegins with 
the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch 
until the path to the desired directory or file is completed.

#Where an absolute pathname starts from the root directory and 
leads to its destination, a relative pathnamestarts from the 
working directory and uses two special notation . That is (.)dot 
and (..)dot dot.
The .notation refers to the working directory, and the ..notation
refers to the working directoryâ€™s parent directory.
