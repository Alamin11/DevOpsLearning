GUI root login issue on Ubuntu
Step 1:
First, complete the root password setup
$sudo passwd
//this will help to set up a new root password wich will be the later user to login to GUI.


Step 2:
Next setting up GDM configuration to allow gui root login
$ nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
As a root user edit the file using nano editor add the 
AllowRoot=true


Step 3:
Now edit PAM authentication daemon configuration file and comment line which denies root access to graphical user interface.
$ nano /etc/pam.d/gdm-password
Now it will open up on nano editor and put # in front of the line containing - 
auth   required        pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success


All done -Now reboot ubuntu system .
And click not listed ? and enter root as user and the root password in the password field .
