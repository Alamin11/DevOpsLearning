SSH server set up in ubuntu step by step
Step 1: First install ssh server as its not in the Linux machine by default using the command as privileged user:- 
$ apt install openssh-server


Step 2: Now Status checking of the installed server daemon that should be up and running -
$ systemctl status ssh


Step 3: start, restart and stop the ssh server using the “systemctl” command -
$ systemctl restart ssh   -> this will restart the ssh server
$ systemctl start ssh   -> this will start the ssh server again
$ systemctl stop ssh   -> this will stop ssh the server


So ssh server installation is done. Now we need to set and config things up:- 
///we can enable ufw before this
#ufw status
If inactive 
#ufw enable 
This will active the ufw 
////////
Step 4: Opening ssh port 22 for incoming traffic on the firewall :
#ufw allow ssh
Step4: Enabling the SSH server to start automatically during boot:-
#systemctl enable ssh


Hostname changing
To change and save the hostname running the following commands:-
Step1: #hostnamectl set-hostname newHostName
This will help to delete the previous hostname and change it to a new hostname 
Step2: 
Now see the hostname change in the hosts’ list 
#nano /etc/hosts
If it remains the previous one just change it to the newHostName that you have given in the step1 command. then save it by pressing 
Ctrl+o -> enter -> ctrl+x


Step 3:
Now check the hostname 
#hostname or
#hostnamectl or
# echo “$HOSTNAME” 


We can check this name before changing the hostname.


Connecting from remote client to my SSH server
Step 1: Obtaining IP address from ssh server using the below command
#ip a
Step2: Now from a client we need to connect to the ssh server 
#ssh root@ip_address
Here root is the server’s username 




***We can change the port 22 as well 
#nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
First, uncomment the “port 22” then change 22 to any port number(8080) we want
ctrl+O -> enter -> ctrl+x
Step3: Now we need to allow the port 
#ufw allow 8080/tcp


Step 4: to apply the change we need to restart the server 
#systemctl restart ssh


*********************
In order to remotely connect to a specific ssh server port we need to use the -p option of ssh command 
# ssh -p 8080 root@192.168.0.109
N.B: In case of a connection establishing issue, we should keep the network type the same in both local and remote machines. 
And another precaution for internet connection issues needs to properly select your internet name and type for wireless/ ethernet connection.
